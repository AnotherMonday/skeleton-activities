  # If this workflow is triggered by a pull request we are explicitly checking out the last commit on the source branch.
  # Otherwise, GitHub would checkout an automatically created merge commit (which causes some issues when creating the 
  # version number for build and package results).
  # The following line has some weird syntax. This a workaround for the missing decision syntax in GitHub Actions 
  # expressions (see: https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/409#issuecomment-727565588).
